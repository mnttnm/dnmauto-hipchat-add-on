# ACE Abotars #

This module for ACE HipChat configures your addon to use an avatar when sending notifications, and will even download one for you from http://abotars.herokuapp.com/. To install into your existing project simply insert the following code somewhere in your application:

```
require('ace-abotars')(addon, app);
```

This will do the following things:

1. Configure your descriptor to have a new entry pointing to your avatar endpoint
2. Add an endpoint /avatar to your application which will serve up your avatar (and add cache headers in production)
3. Download an avatar to avatar.png for you if you do not already have one downloaded.

**Careful** - avatars are downloaded using a random value, and if deleted will be hard to find again.
